# 91906 Programming - Temprature Convertor

This is a Python-based GUI application built by Tkinter for the **NCEA standard AS91906 and AS91907**. This GUI is a temperature convertor that performs conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Description

The purpose of my digital outcomes is to help people (particularly the students in Epsom Girls Grammar School) in interpreting scientific data, understanding and analysing weather information, and for practical applications like cooking. Since the conversion formula between the two units is complicated, it is essential to have a tool that helps users obtain a unified value with the appropriate unit. Therefore, I have decided to make an online no-network-required program for temperature conversion. 

This program is designed to be a temperature conversion calculator that provides a more convenient and time-efficient way for students to calculate accurate data for temperature, drawing from diverse sources and contexts such as math, chemistry, geography, and food technology, among others. In this digital outcome, the users are able to undergo temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. After the calculation, they are allowed to access the calculation history and export the data to a text file or a trend graph for further analysis purposes. 

My target user is all the students in EGGS. However, I need to make sure that everyone from any age group is able to access and use my digital outcomes, as they might also have the same need for temperature conversion. Additionally, as this program might be used under a scientific scenario, I need to make sure that the program is accurate in converting temperatures and outputs the right temperature to the users. 


## Running the Program

### Technology Stack
Language: Python

Addtional Libraries:
* Tkinter
* functools
* re
* datetime
* os
* random
* tkmacosx
* matplotlib


### How to Run
If you would like to have a look of all the small components, you could download all the python files and runs them separately.

If you only want to use the final version of the temperature convertor - just run the **last version** of the final version.

Before run the program...
* Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system
* Make sure that you have installed all the required libraries.
* Download the code and run it in any testing platform (ie. Visual Stidio Code, IDLE...).

Notes: for users with the devices in windows system, you might need to install the 'tkmacosx' library.

### Project Management
This project followed the methodology of combination of Agile and Waterfall methodology, with some other tools like Trello, Gantt Chart, mind map and so on.

## Potential Future Improvements

* Add other conversion options (such as Kelvin and Rankine)
* Enable CSV export for easier spreadsheet integration
* Make a more attractive GUI by improving and adjusting some formats and colours.
